# Minimal Editor
A minimal code editor, made with Python.<br>
Do you not use Python? This editor, in it's beta release at least can run JavaScript, Lua, and Python.<br>
Visit tags section.<br>
[Beta Versions (see non-exe installation)](https://github.com/VideoCarp/minimal_editor/tree/betas)<br>
**Beta Versions are HEAVILY recommended, some things may not function however, worth attempts.**<br>
[Latest](https://github.com/VideoCarp/minimal_editor/releases/tag/v1.0.5)
# Installation
Don't trust the exe file, or on another OS? Follow these steps:
- Install Python (3.6+ should work)
- Download ZIP archive (from tag)
- Extract ZIP archive.
- Create shortcut to main.py at desktop, through the directory you had it installed.
<br>

# Installing the exe file:
Follow these steps, to have the best experience from the app:<br>
- Install .exe file (otherwise follow header above)
- Put it inside a folder **outside of desktop**. Recommended: new folder in documents.
- Right click on desktop, press new and select shortcut.
- Click 'Browse' and find the main .exe file, make sure it's in a folder, and you know where you put it.
- Apply Changes

## Why inside a folder?
This app was written in Python, and for some cases it creates new files that it executes.<br>
For example, you are using the beta release and you clicked 'Run as Lua', this will create a new file, and update it<br>
whenever you attempt to run again as Lua.

# Disclaimers:
This editor only uses standard/built-in Python libraries, so `Ctrl+S` for now doesn't work.<br>
There is probably a way to check for button presses using built-in libraries, but for now, I don't know.<br>
Feel free to submit a pull request, or issue, if you know how, or find any bugs, for more info, visit CONTRIBUTING.md (it may not be there, but it will be)<br>
